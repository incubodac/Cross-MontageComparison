# Cross Montage Comparison

This repository contains a Python example tailored to generate an interpolated version of a 64-electrode montage, utilizing an available 128-electrode dataset. The aim is to preserve spatially corresponding electrodes between the two montages while employing spherical splines interpolation (Perrin, 1989) to fill in the gaps.
